# Why React Testing Library Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The `App.test.js` file contains a very simple React test sample using `React Testing Library`.

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
```
npm test
```

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

The test result looks like this:
